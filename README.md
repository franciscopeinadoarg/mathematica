this program is not very useful but it may help some as a shortcut, for example to grab random numbers without decimals.


IMPORTANT:

you have to create a variable with the value of the function to use it (if you want to print the result and store it)


to use the "numrandom" function you have to put the minimum and maximum in parentheses (separated with comas) (it does not work with strings) 

to use "sum" you have to put the two factors to be added in parentheses (separated by commas) 
all the functions work with the same logic
